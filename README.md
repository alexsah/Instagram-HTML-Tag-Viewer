Instagram-HTML-Tag-Viewer
=========================

This is a web page that runs on javascript that pulls in all images for a given tag on instagram.

This was based on the code found here: http://cfg.good.is/lessons/instagram-api

It is an easy start - and in this source I am using their instagram app key - if you get app 
key failures you may need to get your own from instagram.

###How to use:
Upload to a web server.

All you'll need to do is go to 
instagram.html - it will take show you just the default tag of 1dcoles

You can also use a query string to look for another tag:
instagram.html?tag=whatever - replace whatever with the tag you want to search for.
